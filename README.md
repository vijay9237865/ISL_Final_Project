# ⚠️ Caution: it gonna take time to run since it has to render all 60000 images

## Abstract: 

  The purpose of this project was to create a model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect objects in images captured by a laptop camera. The CIFAR-10 dataset was used to train the model, which consists of 60,000 images in 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.). The model was developed using TensorFlow and Keras, and achieved high accuracy in classifying objects in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model was then integrated into a laptop camera application, allowing it to detect objects in real-time as the camera captures images. The application has shown promising results in detecting objects in various lighting conditions and orientations, demonstrating its potential use in applications such as security, surveillance, and object recognition.
